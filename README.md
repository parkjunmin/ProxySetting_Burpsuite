==================================================

 외부 IP: 203.0.113.1
 내부 IP: 192.168.1.5
 현재 프록시 포트: 8080

 시스템 프록시 상태: 비활성화

--------------------------------------------------
 1. Chrome 실행 (Burp Proxy 사용)
 2. 프록시 설정 해제
 3. 프록시 포트 변경
--------------------------------------------------
Option 1: Launch Chrome with Burp Proxy
Selecting this option will:

Check if Burp Suite is running and launch it if not
Configure system proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080 (or your custom port)
Clean up any previous Chrome profiles
Create a fresh isolated Chrome profile
Launch Chrome configured to use Burp Suite as a proxy

Option 2: Disable Proxy Settings
This option disables the system-wide proxy configuration.
Option 3: Change Proxy Port
Change the port used for the proxy connection (if you need a different port than the default 8080).
💡 How It Works

The script searches for Burp Suite in common installation locations
Creates a fresh Chrome profile in C:\Temp\ChromeBurpProfile-[random]
Configures system proxy settings to route through Burp Suite
Launches Chrome with special flags for proxy configuration
On subsequent runs, cleans up old profile directories

⚠️ Troubleshooting
No Traffic in Burp Suite
Make sure:

Burp Suite Proxy listener is configured for the correct port (default: 8080)
"Intercept is on" is enabled in the Intercept tab
Chrome is actually using the configured proxy (check Chrome settings)

Chrome Profile Creation Errors
If Chrome complains about data directory creation failures:

Make sure C:\Temp directory exists and is writable
Try running the script as Administrator
